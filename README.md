# sgf-parse - A library for parsing SGF files

![Continuous integration](https://github.com/julianandrews/sgf-parse/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

A library for parsing [SGF FF\[4\]](https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/sgf4.html)
files in Rust.

`sgf-parse` provides a reliable but simple structured, standard-compliant
interface for reading and writing`.sgf` files. For all standard SGF data types,
properties are validated and parsed into appropriate native Rust types.
Non-standard properties are parsed and preserved.
